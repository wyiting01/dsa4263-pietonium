<h2>File/Folder Descriptions</h2>
1. Deep Learning - consists of jupyter notebook, python module and requirements needed to train and deploy DistilBert model <br>
2. ML - consists of jupyter notebooks and python scripts needed to train traditional learning algo (SVM and XGBoost) which acts as baseline models
