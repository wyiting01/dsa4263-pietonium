<h1>Deep Learning repository</h1>
<b></b>
This directory is used for storing training scripts of deep learning models being experimented and their associated requirements. 

We fine-tuned two versions of BERT:
  1. **bert-based-cased** from Hugging Face using **Tensorflow**
  2. **distilbert-base-uncased** from Hugging Face using **Pytorch**

The second one is used for presentation and behind scoring API
